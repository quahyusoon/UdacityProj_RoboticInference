# Udacity Student Project: Robotic Inference
Collect image data and train deep neural network models with GoogLeNet on NVIDIA’s DIGITS

In this project, students will learn the following:

- Leveraging NVIDIA’s DIGITS workflow to rapidly prototype classification networks, detection networks, segmentation networks and even more!

- Exploring a variety of hyperparameters for training the networks

Full report can refer to [here](robotic-inference.pdf).

## Start DIGITS
In Udacity DIGITS Workspace, start the DIGITS server by entering the command digits into a terminal. This will begin the boot of the DIGITS server (it will take a minute). From another terminal, run print_connection.sh in order to get the link for the DIGITS GUI (Graphical User Interface). Keeping this script running will keep your workspace active if you are training a network but be sure to quit it if you are not using the workspace.

## Create Dataset, Define Network's Hyperparameters And Train The Model
The steps would be explained via Jupyter Notebooks below:
- [Training a model](Image Classification with DIGITS - Training a model.ipynb)

- [Improving model accuracy](Image Classification with DIGITS - Improving Performance.ipynb)
